          <p>The first thing we did upon moving in was to trash the flower chandelier and throw up a Tara Donovan inspired installation. This marked the true beginning of The Beehive House. We are an innovative collaborative of rising photographers, film makers, web and graphic designers. We enjoy a good laugh and long walks on the beach so feel free to join us for a date you'll never forget.</p>
